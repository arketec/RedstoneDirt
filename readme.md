# Redstone Dirt

A simple mod that adds a powered block of dirt by combining a dirt and redstone dust in a crafting grid

This block will strongly power blocks adjacent to it (indicated by redstone particles)

Power can be disabled by right-clicking the block with a hoe (indicated by particles stopping)
